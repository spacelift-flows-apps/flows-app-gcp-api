            'A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.  If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.  The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ```  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```  If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:  `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq \'single quoted literal\'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`  The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.  You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.',
